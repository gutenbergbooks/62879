<br />THE NATIONAL GEM COLLECTION</h2>
<p>Man has been using certain mineral species for personal
adornment since prehistoric times. However, of the
almost 2000 different mineral species, relatively few,
perhaps only 100, have been used traditionally as gems. To be
used as a gem, a mineral species must have durability as well as
beauty. Lack of durability eliminates most minerals as gems,
although some relatively fragile gem materials such as opal are
prized because of their exceptional beauty. Actually, some gem
materials are not minerals at all. Pearl, amber, jet, and coral
are formed by living organisms.</p>
<p>In the National Gem Collection, the Smithsonian Institution
has assembled a large representation of all known gem materials.
The display portion of the collection consists of more
than 1000 items selected to illustrate the various kinds of gems
and to show how their beauty is enhanced by cutting and
polishing. All of these gems are gifts of public-spirited donors
who, by giving the gems directly or by establishing endowments
for their purchase, have contributed to the enjoyment of
the many thousands of persons who visit the Smithsonian
Institution each week.</p>
<p>The National Gem Collection had its beginning in 1884
when Prof. F. W. Clarke, then honorary curator of the Division
of Mineralogy, prepared an exhibit of American precious
stones as a part of the Smithsonian Institution&rsquo;s display at the
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
New Orleans Exposition. The same collection was displayed
at the Cincinnati Exposition the following year. Between 1886
and 1890 the growth of the collection was slow, but in 1891
most of the precious stones collected by Dr. Joseph Leidy of
Philadelphia were obtained, and these, combined with those
already on hand, were exhibited at the World&rsquo;s Columbian
Exposition at Chicago in 1893.</p>
<p>Great stimulus was given the collection in 1894 when Mrs.
Frances Lea Chamberlain bequeathed the precious stones
assembled by her father, Dr. Isaac Lea. Her husband, Dr.
Leander T. Chamberlain, who in 1897 became honorary
curator of the collection, contributed a large number of specimens
and, upon his death, left an endowment fund. The income
from that fund has been used to steadily increase the collection
over the years. Extremely rare and costly gems suitable for
exhibition are beyond the income derived from the Chamberlain
endowment, but this gap has been filled by many important
donations, the most notable being the gift of the Hope Diamond
by Harry Winston, Inc., New York City. Thus, from modest
beginnings in 1884, there has been accumulated the magnificent
collection of gems belonging to the people of the United States.
The collection is displayed in the Smithsonian Institution&rsquo;s
great Museum of Natural History.</p>

<br />THE STUDY OF GEMS</h2>
<p>To the average person it might seem that a jeweler&rsquo;s showcase
of gems presents innumerable kinds of precious
stones, when actually only a few species of minerals are
there. Perhaps only diamond, ruby, emerald, aquamarine,
sapphire, opal, tourmaline, and amethyst would comprise the
entire stock. Yet, since the mineral kingdom consists of about
2000 distinct species, it would seem that a few more kinds of
gemstones would be available. Certainly, many more minerals
than are seen displayed by the jeweler have been used as gems
over the centuries. The study of all these species of gem minerals
constitutes modern gemology&mdash;a specialized branch of
the science of mineralogy.</p>
<p>With the few exceptions already noted, all gems are minerals
found in the earth&rsquo;s crust. A mineral is a natural substance
having a definite chemical composition and definite physical
characteristics by which it can be recognized. However, for a
mineral to qualify as a gem it must have at least some of the
accepted requirements&mdash;brilliance, beauty, durability, rarity,
and portability. Of course, if a gemstone happens to be
&ldquo;fashionable&rdquo; it will have additional importance. Rarely does
a single gem possess all of these qualities. A fine-quality
diamond, having a high degree of brilliance and fire, together
with extreme hardness and great rarity, comes closest to this
ideal, and in the world of fashion the diamond is unchallenged
among gems. The opal, by contrast, is relatively fragile, and it
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
depends mainly on its rarity and its beautiful play of colors
to be considered gem material.</p>
<p>When a gem material, as found in nature, has at least a
minimum number of the necessary qualities, it is then the task
of the lapidary, or gem cutter, to cut it and polish it in such a
way as to take greatest advantage of all its possibilities for
beauty and adornment.</p>
<h3>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF GEMSTONES</h3>
<p>When a gemologist or a gem cutter examines an unworked
mineral fragment (called <i>rough</i>) he looks for certain
distinguishing characteristics that will aid him in identifying
the mineral and in determining the procedures he should
use in cutting it.</p>
<table class="center">
<tr class="th"><th colspan="2">Scale of Hardness</th></tr>
<tr><td class="c">Soft </td><td class="l">1. Talc</td></tr>
<tr><td class="c">^ </td><td class="l">2. Gypsum</td></tr>
<tr><td class="c"> </td><td class="l">3. Calcite</td></tr>
<tr><td class="c"> </td><td class="l">4. Fluorite</td></tr>

<tr><td class="c"><span class="ssn">v</span> </td><td class="l">9. Corundum</td></tr>
<tr><td class="c">Hard </td><td class="l">10. Diamond</td></tr>
</table>
<p>It is difficult to list these characteristics in the order of
importance, but <i>hardness</i> would rank high. Hardness of a gem is
best defined as its resistance to abrasion or scratching. Most
commonly used for comparison is the Mohs scale, which consists
of selected common minerals
arranged in the order of increasing
hardness. On this scale,
topaz is rated as 8 in hardness,
ruby as 9, and diamond, the
hardest known substance, as 10.
Any gem with a hardness less
than that of quartz, number 7
in the scale, is unlikely to be
sufficiently scratch-resistant for
use as a gem. A less precise
scale, using common objects for
comparison, might include the
fingernail with a hardness up to
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
2&frac12;, a copper coin up to 3, a knife blade to 5&frac12;, a piece of
window glass at about 5&frac12;, and a steel file between 6 and 7,
depending on the type of steel. By this scale, any stone that
remains unmarred after being scraped by a piece of window
glass will have a hardness greater than 5&frac12;. The more important
gemstones&mdash;which include diamond, ruby, sapphire, and
emerald&mdash;all have a hardness much greater than 5&frac12;.</p>
<p>The size of a gemstone usually is indicated by its <i>weight</i> in
carats. The expression &ldquo;a 10-carat stone&rdquo; has meaning&mdash;if
somewhat inexact&mdash;even to the nonexpert. Specifically, a
carat is one-fifth of a gram, which is a unit of weight in the
metric system small enough so that approximately 28 grams
make an ounce. A 140-carat gemstone, then, weighs about an
ounce.</p>
<p>Another distinguishing characteristic of a gemstone is its
specific gravity, which is an expression of the relationship between
the stone&rsquo;s own weight and the weight of an equal volume of
water. We are aware of a difference in weight when we compare
lead and wood, yet it would not always be correct to say
that lead weighs more than wood, for a large piece of wood
can weigh more than a small piece of lead. Only by comparing
equal volumes of these materials can the extent of the weight
difference be clear and unmistakable. Diamond is 3&frac12; times
heavier than the same volume of water, so its specific gravity
is 3.5. Since each species of gem has its own specific gravity,
which can be determined without harming the stone, this
standard of comparison is a valuable aid in identifying gems.
Several techniques have been devised for determining specific
gravity, and most of them make use of some kind of weighing
device or balance.</p>
<p>Among the most striking and useful of the distinguishing
characteristics of gemstones are those that involve the effects
on light.</p>
<p>An important effect of a gem on light is the production of
color, upon which many gems depend for their beauty. Some
gem materials, such as lapis lazuli, have little to offer except
color. Many gemstones vary widely in color, owing to the
presence of varying but extremely small amounts of impurities.
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
Thus, the gemstone beryl may occur as blue-green (aquamarine),
as pink (morganite), as rich green (emerald), as
yellow (golden beryl), or even colorless (goshenite).</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="317" />
<p class="pcap">Sketch of a simple balance used to determine specific gravity of a
gemstone. The operator places the gemstone in the upper pan (A),
moves the weight (B) along the beam (C) until it balances perfectly,
and notes the number at the weight&rsquo;s position. He then transfers
the gemstone to the lower pan (D), which is completely immersed
in water, and moves the weight along the beam to restore balance.
He notes the scale number at the new position and determines the
specific gravity simply by dividing the first number by the difference
between the two numbers. If the gemstone is large, the operator can
use heavier sliding weights. (E).</p>
</div>
<p>Gemstones such as beryl and sapphire that depend on impurities
for their color are said to be <i>allochromatic</i>; others, such
as peridot and garnet, which are highly colored even when
pure, are said to be <i>idiochromatic</i>. The color of a gem is further
described according to its <i>hue</i>, <i>tint</i>, and <i>intensity</i>. Hue refers to
the kind of color, such as red, yellow, green, etc.; tint refers to
the lightness or darkness of the hue; and intensity refers to
vividness or dullness. Throughout history, the most popular
colored stones have been those with hues of red, green, or blue
of dark tint and high intensity.</p>

<p class="pcap">Asterism (star effect) is caused by
parallel inclusions arranged in
several directions related to the
crystal structure of the gemstone.
Two rays in the 175-carat, 6-rayed
star garnet from Idaho (at left in

four because of fewer inclusions in
that direction. The 23-carat star
orthoclase from Ceylon shows
brightly all of its four possible rays.
(Actual size.)</p>
</div>
<p>The effect of a gem on light may be more than the production
of color. Several of the so-called phenomenal stones are prized
for other effects. Holes, bubbles, and foreign particles, when
properly aligned in parallel groupings, can produce interesting
light effects. The play of colors of opal and labradorite, the
<i>chatoyancy</i> or silky sheen of tiger&rsquo;s-eye and cat&rsquo;s-eye, the
<i>opalescence</i> or pearly reflections of opal and moonstone, and the
<i>asterism</i> or star effect of rubies and sapphires are caused by the
reaction of light to minute <i>inclusions</i> or imperfections in the
gemstone.</p>
<p>When light passes into or through a gemstone with little or
no interruption, the stone is said to be transparent, as opposed
to a stone through which light passes with greater difficulty,
and which is said to be either translucent or opaque, depending
on the degree of light interruption.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/p07g.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="436" />
<p class="pcap">Rays of light passing into a gemstone
are refracted (bent) in varying
amounts depending on the gem
species and also on the angle at
which the light strikes the stone.
The light rays are reflected back
toward the top of the stone by
internal faces (facets), and they
are refracted again as they leave.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<div class="img" id="fig10">

<p class="pcap">How a gem refractometer, a simple device to operate, is used to measure
quickly the refractive index of a cut gemstone. A light beam
passing through the opening (A) is reflected from the table of a
gemstone (G) through a lens system (L) and, by prism (P), into the
eye of the observer (E). The maximum angle of reflection (N),
which depends on the refractive index of the gemstone, controls the
angle at which the beam comes through the eyepiece (EP). The
refractive index is read directly from a scale in the eyepiece.</p>
</div>
<p>The action of a gemstone upon the light which strikes its
surface and is either reflected or passed through it sometimes
results in highly desirable effects that enhance its beauty and aid
in its identification. Light passing into a stone is bent from its
path, and the amount of bending (<i>refraction</i>) depends upon the
species of the gemstone. When the degree of bending can be
measured, the gem species can be identified, since very few
species of gemstones bend light to exactly the same degree. An
instrument called a gem refractometer is used to determine the
degree to which cut stones refract, or bend, light. The measurement
obtained is the <i>refractive index</i> of the gemstone.</p>
<p>Many gemstones can split a beam of light and bend one part
more than the other, thus producing <i>double refraction</i>, or two
different measurements of refractive index.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/p08a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="484" />
<p class="pcap">When a ray of ordinary white light enters
some gemstones it is dispersed (split up)
into rays of the separate colors of which it
is composed. These rays are reflected inside
the gem and are further separated by additional
refraction as they leave the gemstone.
This dispersion accounts for the colored
flashes of light, or fire, for which diamond
is highly prized.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Gems have the ability to separate &ldquo;white light&rdquo; (the mixture
of all colors) into its various colors, producing flashes of
red, yellow, green, and other colors. Separation occurs because
the various colors, or wavelengths composing white light
passing through the gem, are each bent or refracted a different
amount. Red is bent least, followed in order by orange,
yellow, green, blue, and violet, which is bent most. This
characteristic of being able to produce flashes of color, as seen
prominently in diamond, is known as <i>dispersion</i> or <i>fire</i>. Quartz
and glass have low dispersion, and hence they make poor
diamond substitutes. Some of the newer synthetic gemstones,
such as titania, have extremely high dispersion, with resulting
fire. Zircon, a natural gemstone of suitable hardness, exhibits
high dispersion and is a commonly used substitute for
diamond.</p>
<h3>CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF GEMSTONES</h3>
<p>Since gems are embraced in the mineral kingdom, and minerals
are naturally occurring chemical substances, it follows
that all the accepted terms of chemical description can be
applied to them. When a chemist learns that ruby is an impure
aluminum oxide, he understands a great deal about the nature,
origin, and behavior of ruby. He can assign to it the chemical
formula Al&#8322;O&#8323;, symbolizing its basic composition as two atoms
of aluminum united with three of oxygen. Similarly, other popular
gemstones can be described chemically as follows:</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td class="l">Diamond </td><td class="l">Carbon </td><td class="l">C</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Sapphire </td><td class="l">Aluminum oxide </td><td class="l">Al&#8322;O&#8323;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Quartz </td><td class="l">Silicon dioxide </td><td class="l">SiO&#8322;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Emerald </td><td class="l">Beryllium aluminum silicate </td><td class="l">Be&#8323;Al&#8322;(SiO&#8323;)&#8326;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Spinel </td><td class="l">Magnesium aluminate </td><td class="l">Mg(AlO&#8322;)&#8322;</td></tr>
</table>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Significantly, ruby and sapphire are chemically identical, both
being of the mineral species corundum. As already explained,
the difference in color is due entirely to very slight traces of
chemical impurities. Frequently, the impurities are present in
irregular patches that give spotty color effects.</p>
<p>Some mineral species possess many of the desirable qualities
of gemstones yet cannot be used as gems because they are
chemically active and therefore are less durable. They undergo
alteration and decomposition when exposed to light or to one
or another of such substances as air, water, skin acids and oils.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">3</span>
<br />THE SHAPING OF GEMSTONES</h2>
<p>Gemstone crystals often have naturally brilliant, reflecting
faces, but rarely are they perfect and unblemished. Also,
their natural shapes do not provide the best expression of
their luster, brilliance, dispersion, color, and other inherent
properties. In fashioning a gemstone, the skilled artisan tries to
develop these hidden assets and to otherwise enhance the
gemstone&rsquo;s general beauty.</p>
<p>From ancient times until the 1600&rsquo;s little was attempted in
the way of shaping gemstones other than to smooth or polish
the natural form. Although similarly smoothed, or <i>tumbled</i>, gemstones
recently have returned to fashion, the finest pieces of
gem rough are now converted mainly into <i>faceted</i>, or shaped,
stones. Standard types of facets&mdash;the flat faces that are
ground and polished on the rough gem material&mdash;have been
given individual and group names. A typical example is the
<i>brilliant</i> cut, which is most commonly used to best bring out
the qualities of a diamond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="416" />
<p class="pcap">The standard brilliant cut, with a pattern of many

emerging through inclined facets, are split up by dispersion
into the rainbow, or fire, effect so prized in diamonds. A stone
that has been cut too wide for its depth, with incorrect facet
angles, will look large for its weight but its brilliance and
fire will have been drastically reduced.</p>

number of basic cuts have been developed. The <i>brilliant</i> and <i>step</i>
cuts are by far the commonest of these basic cuts, but modern
jewelry design frequently uses such fancy cuts as the baguette,
cut-corner triangle, epaulet, half moon, hexagon, keystone, kite,

the blade is cutting its way through a piece of gem tourmaline.</p>
</div>
<p>In general, there are three operations in preparing a gemstone
from the rough&mdash;sawing, grinding, and polishing. Sawing
usually is accomplished by using a thin, diamond-impregnated,
rapidly rotating disk of soft iron or bronze, with oil or water
being used as a coolant. The very hard diamond dust literally
scratches its way through the stone. Once the stone is sawed to
shape, the facets are ground and polished on a rotating horizontal
disk by the use of various abrasives. For rough grinding,
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
silicon carbide&mdash;or sometimes diamond powder&mdash;is used.
Scratches are removed and a high polish is given by the use of
tin oxide, pumice, rouge, or other fine-grained abrasives. The
thick disks, or laps, are made of cast iron, copper, lead, pewter,
wood, cloth, leather, and certain other materials. Since each
species of gemstone differs in its characteristics, each must be
treated somewhat differently as to sawing and lapping speeds,
kind of lap, and choice of abrasives. Because of the greatly
increased interest in gem cutting as a hobby and the large
number of amateur cutters, a substantial market has developed
in the United States for lapidary supplies and equipment. New
kinds of machinery, new abrasives, and new kinds of saws and
laps are introduced regularly. Fundamentally, however, the
process still involves sawing, grinding, and polishing.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig24">
<img src="images/p12.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="678" />
<p class="pcap">The final step in preparing a gemstone from rough is the applying

<p>Shaping of gemstones is not limited to geometric faceting.
Many stones, especially those which are opaque or which produce
stars and cat&rsquo;s-eyes, are cut as <i>cabochons</i>. This ancient, and
probably oldest, cutting style consists merely of a raised and
rounded form. When extended completely around the stone,
the cabochon form results in a bead that can be drilled and
strung. Many cabochons, especially those of less expensive gem
materials, are now cut in large quantities to standard sizes in
order to fit mass-produced gem mountings.</p>
<p>Sculpting in gemstones is a much more intricate, nongeometric
kind of shaping. Although tools differ in detail, and the
gem sculptor must possess an artistic eye as well as lapidary
skill, the basic processes of sawing, grinding, and polishing
are the same.</p>

<br />GEM SUBSTITUTES</h2>
<p>Because of their rarity and relatively high cost, the number of
real gems used throughout recorded times must be insignificant
compared to the number of gem substitutes used.
There are records of glass and ceramic imitations of gems as
early as 3000 B.C. Certainly, the world gem markets today
are flooded with man-made gems. There even has been developed
a laboratory process for growing a coating of synthetic emerald
on the surface of a faceted stone of natural colorless beryl.
The recut gem looks like a natural emerald, and it has natural
inclusions that totally synthetic emeralds lack.</p>
<p>In general, gem substitutes can be classified as imitation
stones, assembled stones, reconstructed and altered stones, and
synthetic stones.</p>
<h3>IMITATION STONES</h3>
<p>Any material will serve as an imitation of a natural gem
as long as it resembles the real thing under casual
examination. Because of the great variety in types and colors
available, glass and plastics are the most commonly used
materials for making imitation gems. Almost every gem has
been simulated effectively. The substitutes offer no difficulty
of identification to the expert, but many are deceptive to the
layman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h3>ASSEMBLED STONES</h3>
<p>It has been the practice for centuries to
build up gemstones by fusing or cementing
a shaped piece of natural
gemstone to another piece, or other
pieces, of inferior or artificial material.</p>
<p>A colorless common beryl crown cemented
to a pavilion of green glass produces
an emerald doublet&mdash;part natural,
part artificial&mdash;of good color and high
durability. A thin piece of beautifully
colored opal cemented to a base of inferior
opal provides an assembled stone
that looks like a thick piece of high-quality
opal. Triplets, and even stones
in which there are pockets of colored
liquids or metal foil between the
shaped pieces, are known.</p>
<p>Usually, assembled stones are easily
detected, since the joint will show
under magnification, but sometimes
they are mounted in settings that
obscure the joint, and detection is
more difficult.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig30">
<img src="images/p14.jpg" alt="" width="296" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Assembled imitation gemstones. If it were measured
on its natural ruby table, the assembled stone shown
at top would have all the characteristics of a large
ruby, including refractive index. The color of the
quartz and glass combination (middle) depends on
the color of the liquid in the cavity. Since emerald
is green beryl, an inexpensive colorless beryl sandwich
of green glass (bottom) would appear to be
an expensive emerald. The joints of assembled
stones often are hidden in the jewelry mountings.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<h3>RECONSTRUCTED AND ALTERED STONES</h3>
<p>Ruby fragments may be heated at high temperature to
partially melt them into a large mass that can be cut into
a more valuable stone. Ruby is the only stone that can be
successfully reconstituted in this way, but there are many
other ways of tampering with natural stones to make them
more desirable.</p>
<p>Sometimes natural stones are backed with foil or a metallic
coating to enhance their color, to provide brilliance, or to produce
a star effect. It is said that in an inventory of the Russian
crown jewels by the Soviet Government, the ruby-colored
Paul the First Diamond was discovered to be a pale pink
diamond backed by red foil. Today, some diamonds are coated
on the back with a blue film to improve their color.</p>
<p>Aquamarine, when pale greenish blue, may be heated in
order to deepen the blue color, and poorly colored amethyst
may be heated to produce a beautiful yellow-brown quartz,
called citrine, that often is misrepresented as topaz. By strong
heating, the brown and reddish brown colors of zircon can be
changed to blue or colorless, both of which states are unknown
in natural zircon. Dyes, plastics, and oils are used to impregnate
porous gems such as turquoise and variscite, and even jade.
Off-color diamonds, when exposed to strong atomic radiation,
can be changed to attractive green, brown, and yellow colors,
causing them to resemble higher-priced <i>fancies</i>.</p>
<p>In the constant search for something new, gem suppliers
sometimes introduce into gemstones colors that are not always
an improvement. For example, the beautiful purple of some
amethyst can be converted, by heat treatment, to a peculiar
green. Such an altered stone is marketed as <i>greened amethyst</i>.</p>
<p>All of this tampering with gemstones complicates the problem
of identification, so it is a matter of serious concern to the
gem trade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h3>SYNTHETIC STONES</h3>
<p>For over 200 years mineralogists have been devising techniques
for producing synthetic minerals in the laboratory,
and attempts have been made, sometimes with considerable
success, to apply these techniques to the production of synthetic
gemstones. To qualify as a synthetic gemstone the man-made
product must be identical chemically and structurally with its
natural counterpart. Sapphire, ruby, spinel, emerald, and
rutile in gem quality have been brought to commercial
production.</p>
<p>Two of the basic techniques used in producing synthetic
gems are the <i>flame-fusion</i> and the <i>hydrothermal</i> processes.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig31">
<img src="images/p15.jpg" alt="" width="279" height="800" />
<p class="pcap">The Verneuil furnace, for making synthetic
gem rough. A mixture of hydrogen
(H) and oxygen (O) burns almost explosively,
heating the fusion chamber (F)
to high temperatures. For example,
powdered aluminum oxide and coloring
agents are sifted down from hopper (A)
to the fusion chamber and form a cylindrical
boule (B) on an adjustable stand
(C).</p>
</div>
<p>In the flame-fusion process&mdash;invented in 1904
by the French chemist Verneuil&mdash;powdered
aluminum oxide, containing coloring agents, is
sieved down through the flame of a vertical
blowtorch furnace. As it passes through the
flame, the powder melts and accumulates as
drops on an adjustable stand just below the
flame, where it forms a single crystal <i>boule</i> of
the synthetic rough. In a few hours a boule of
several hundred carats can be formed. When
such furnaces are operated in banks of several
hundred units, the commercial production of
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
corundum alone becomes possible at the rate of many tons a
year. Through the years, of course, refinements have been made
on Verneuil&rsquo;s original furnace.</p>
<p>In the hydrothermal process, which differs greatly from
Verneuil&rsquo;s flame-fusion process, crystals are grown from solutions
of the raw materials that have been subjected to varying
conditions of very high pressure and temperature. Some of the
quartz used for electronics purposes also is manufactured in
this way.</p>
<p>Since chemical composition and crystal structure are the
basic characteristics by which a gemstone is identified, and
these characteristics are identical in both the manufactured
stone and its natural counterpart, the synthetic gemstones
offer a very serious challenge to those concerned with gem
identification.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">5</span>
<br />GEM LORE</h2>
<p>All sorts of magic and symbolic properties have been
ascribed to gemstones through the ages; for example, the
cat&rsquo;s-eye has been prescribed as a cure for paleness, citrine
has been worn as a protection from danger, and the opal
cherished as the symbol of hope. The result has been the
creation of an intricate, chaotic, and contradictory but interesting
mass of gem lore.</p>
<p>Among the treasures in the Smithsonian&rsquo;s Museum of Natural
History is a very old silver breastplate that once was in an
ancient synagogue and supposedly was modeled after the one
worn by Aaron, the first high priest of the Hebrews. In this
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
plate are mounted twelve stones representing the Twelve
Tribes of Israel. Among Christians, the Twelve Apostles also
were represented symbolically by precious stones.</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt class="center">THE TWELVE TRIBES</dt>
<dt>Levi, <i>Garnet</i></dt>
<dt>Zebulon, <i>Diamond</i></dt>
<dt>Gad, <i>Amethyst</i></dt>

<dt>Joseph, <i>Onyx</i></dt>
<dt>Reuben, <i>Sard</i></dt>

<dt>Bartholomew, <i>Sard</i></dt>
<dt>Matthew, <i>Chrysolite</i></dt>
<dt>Thomas, <i>Beryl</i></dt>
<dt>James the Less, <i>Topaz</i></dt>
<dt>Jude, <i>Chrysoprase</i></dt>
<dt>Simon, <i>Hyacinth</i></dt>
<dt>Judas, <i>Amethyst</i></dt></dl>
<p>The number &ldquo;12&rdquo; seems to follow a chain of gemstone
superstitions. Gemstones were considered to have mystical
relationship not only with the Twelve Tribes and the Twelve
Apostles but also with the Twelve Angels, the Twelve Ranks
of the Devil, and the Twelve Parts of the human body.</p>
<p>Some stones were even endowed with astrological significance
and were believed to be in sympathy with the twelve
zodiacal signs. On the basis of an elaborate system of prognostications,
an astrologer was considered able to foretell
future events by proper observance of changes in hue and
brilliance of the symbolic stones.</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>Aries the Ram, <i>Bloodstone</i></dt>
<dt>Taurus the Bull, <i>Sapphire</i></dt>
<dt>Gemini the Twins, <i>Agate</i></dt>
<dt>Cancer the Crab, <i>Emerald</i></dt>

<dt>Libra the Scales, <i>Chrysolite</i></dt>
<dt>Scorpio the Scorpion, <i>Aquamarine</i></dt>
<dt>Sagittarius the Archer, <i>Topaz</i></dt>
<dt>Capricornus the Goat, <i>Ruby</i></dt>
<dt>Aquarius the Water Bearer, <i>Garnet</i></dt>
<dt>Pisces the Fishes, <i>Amethyst</i></dt></dl>
<p>Perhaps in our own space-oriented times the ancient superstitions
sympathetically relating certain gemstones with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
planets will be revived. In the distant past,
moonstone, topaz, and other white stones were
believed to be in sympathy with the Moon,
diamond and ruby with the Sun, jasper and
emerald with Mars, amethyst, topaz, and
emerald with Venus, carnelian, topaz, and
amethyst with Jupiter, turquoise and sapphire
with Saturn, and rock crystal, agate, and emerald
with Mercury. Since Uranus, Neptune, and
Pluto were unknown to the ancients, these
planets have not been represented by gemstones.</p>
<p>Of special interest to the American public
are birthstones. Many birthstone lists have
been proposed, and in order to use this idea to
popularize gemstones the American jewelry
industry has agreed upon an official list. This
list has served to bring about some uniformity
in the selection of birthstones for the twelve
months.</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>January, <i>Garnet</i></dt>
<dt>February, <i>Amethyst</i></dt>
<dt>March, <i>Aquamarine</i> or <i>Bloodstone</i></dt>
<dt>April, <i>Diamond</i></dt>
<dt>May, <i>Emerald</i></dt>
<dt>June, <i>Moonstone</i> or <i>Pearl</i></dt>

<dt>August, <i>Peridot</i> or <i>Sardonyx</i></dt>
<dt>September, <i>Sapphire</i></dt>
<dt>October, Opal or <i>Tourmaline</i></dt>
<dt>November, <i>Topaz</i> or <i>Citrine</i></dt>
<dt>December, <i>Turquoise</i> or <i>Lapis lazuli</i></dt></dl>
<p>All these associations and strange beliefs
have served to create in the general public a
mental image of gemstones that gives to them
an increased exoticism and mysterious appeal
far exceeding their monetary value.</p>

<br />PRINCIPAL GEM SPECIES</h2>
<p>An excursion into the literature of gems would reveal that
there is much to be discovered about them other than the
cold facts of gemology, techniques of gem cutting, and
tales of gem lore. When all the information about an individual
species is assembled, it provides a sketch of a fascinating gemstone
personality. Whole books have been written about
diamond&mdash;books filled with essays on its mining history,
natural occurrences, scientific significance, and best known
cut stones.</p>
<p>In the following sections of this book, some of the facts about
several of the better known gem species have been gathered.
The treatment is not meant to be complete, but enough information
is given so that the Museum visitor may better understand
and remember what he has seen.</p>
<p>For each species described there are color illustrations of
certain gemstones displayed in the collection. Several photographic
and artistic techniques have been used to emphasize
the various aspects of the beauty of these stones, many of which
are the largest and finest of their kinds known; however, not all
of the finest gems are pictured here.</p>
<p>At the end of this descriptive section is a list of the significant
faceted gemstones in the collection. Obviously, this list
will change, because new gemstones constantly are being
acquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h3>DIAMOND</h3>
<p>Diamond is the king of gems. It is a form of pure carbon,
and it is the hardest substance known; only diamond will
cut diamond. It is interesting that the humble graphite,
its close relative, is also pure carbon, but graphite is so soft
that it is used as a lubricant and for making the &ldquo;lead&rdquo; in
pencils.</p>
<p>The ancients believed diamond to be indestructible, and
even today many people believe that diamond cannot be broken.
Despite its great hardness, however, diamond is not exceptionally
tough, and it can be split along what diamond cutters
call its <i>grain</i>.</p>
<p>The diamond&rsquo;s high brilliance results from its very high
refraction, or ability to bend light, and its fire is caused by its
high dispersion, or ability to divide light into its rainbow
colors. However, only in properly cut stones are diamond&rsquo;s
brilliance and fire developed to their maximum.</p>
<p>At great depths in the crust of the earth and under conditions
of very high pressure and temperature, diamonds form in pipe-like
bodies of kimberlite, a heavy dark rock consisting primarily
of two minerals, pyroxene and olivine. In South Africa
diamonds are mined from the kimberlite, but they also are
recovered there and elsewhere from beds of sand and gravel
where they have accumulated after being released from their
mother rock by erosion.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s largest diamond deposits are in Africa, and
names such as Congo, Sierra Leone, and the Union of South
Africa bring to mind colorful legends of fabulous discoveries of
diamond. Smaller deposits are found in South America&mdash;in
Brazil, British Guiana, and Venezuela&mdash;and in Asia. Even in
the United States some diamonds have been found.</p>
<p>India was the most important source of diamond until 1728,
when discoveries were made in Brazil. Among the important
large diamonds found in India were the Koh-i-noor, the Great
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
Mogul, and, very likely, the Hope Diamond. Like India, Brazil
in turn declined as a major source of diamond with the discovery
and efficient recovery of large quantities in South Africa.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig32">
<img src="images/p17.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="596" />
<p class="pcap">The Hope Diamond, because of its long and dramatic history and its
rare deep-blue color, is probably the best known diamond in the
world. By speculation, the Hope is linked to the famous &ldquo;French
Blue,&rdquo; which was brought to France from India in 1668 to become
part of the crown jewels of Louis XIV. The French Blue was stolen
in 1792 and never recovered, but in 1830 an extraordinary 44.5-carat
blue diamond&mdash;presumably cut from the missing gem&mdash;came on the
market. It was purchased by Henry Thomas Hope of England and
became known by its present name. In 1949 the gem was acquired
from the estate of Mrs. Evalyn Walsh McLean by Harry Winston
Inc., of New York. Ten years later, Harry Winston, Inc., presented
the gem (shown here in actual size) to the Smithsonian Institution.</p>
</div>
<p>Diamonds are extremely rare even in diamond mines. For
example, the famous South African mines contain only one part
of diamond in more than 14 million parts of worthless rock.
In spite of this, more than three tons of gem- and industrial-quality
diamond were mined in 1963.</p>
<p>Among the British crown jewels is a cut diamond weighing
530.20 carats (more than 3&frac34; ounces), one of several stones
that were cut from the largest gem diamond ever discovered.
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
The rough stone, known as the Cullinan Diamond,
weighed 3106 carats (almost 1&frac34; pounds) when it was found
at the Premier Mine in South Africa in 1905.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig33">
<img src="images/p18.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="566" />
<p class="pcap">The Portuguese Diamond, weighing 127 carats, is the 13th largest cut
diamond on record. More unusual, it is from Brazil, and is thought to have
been part of the Portuguese crown jewels. In addition to its brilliant color
flashes, it has a slight milky fluorescence that causes it to &ldquo;glow&rdquo; even in
artificial light. (Actual size.)</p>
</div>
<p>Diamonds vary from colorless to black and from transparent
to opaque. As they come from the mines, they are
graded into two groups, gem and industrial. Those whose
color, imperfection, or shape make them useless as gems&mdash;more
than 8 out of every 10 carats mined&mdash;are used in industry.
Diamonds of industrial quality also are produced synthetically,
and these are used primarily in the manufacture of grinding
wheels.</p>
<p>The best gem diamonds are flawless and are colorless or
slightly blue. Their value depends on their color, clarity, cut,
and carat weight. Most costly are those called fancies, which
have a distinct color such as blue, pink, green, or deep yellow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<h3>PEARL</h3>
<p>Pearl is included among gemstones only because it is a
beautiful object used as jewelry. As has been noted, pearl
is not mineral because it is formed by the action of a living
organism. However, the pearl has long occupied an important
position among jewels, and it is unique in requiring no lapidary
art to enhance its beauty. Nature has perfected pearls.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig34">
<img src="images/p18a.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="763" />
<p class="pcap">The strand of matched pearls was
presented to President Van Buren
by the Imam of Muscat. The three
baroque (irregularly shaped)
pearls are freshwater pearls from
the Wabash River in Indiana.</p>
</div>
<p>The ancient Chinese believed that pearls originated in the
brain of a dragon. We now know, of course, that pearl is
created by a secretion of a mollusk. Very few mollusks have the
ability to produce the fine mother-of-pearl used in the jewelry
trade, and even among those that can, very few produce pearls
with iridescence, or <i>orient</i>, as it is known in the trade. Only
two genera, the pearl oyster (<i>Margaritifera</i>) and the pearl
mussel (<i>Unio</i>) are important sources of the gem. Edible
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
oysters rarely produce pearls, and when they do, the pearls are
of poor quality.</p>
<p>The shells of pearl-producing mollusks are composed of
layers of calcium carbonate in the form of either calcite or
aragonite. These layers, cemented together with an organic
substance known as conchiolin, are known as nacre. The layer
closest to the animal is deposited in tiny overlapping patches,
producing an iridescent effect caused by the interference of
light rays reflected from the plates making up the nacre. The
same material coats the surface of a gem pearl.</p>
<p>Seldom does a mollusk live out its time without attack by
creatures boring through its shell, or without intrusion through
the normal shell opening of tiny parasitic worms, sand, or
other irritants. Usually inert particles are forced against the
inside of the shell, where they are covered with layers of pearl
that fasten them to the shell. This is the source of most <i>blister
pearls</i>. When the irritant remains in its fleshy part, the mollusk
deposits a protective shell of pearl to cover it completely, and a
spherical pearl may result. Pearls of less-symmetrical shape,
called <i>baroques</i>, are more common.</p>
<p>The value of a pearl depends on its shape, color, orient, and
size. Pearls of highest value are white with a faint tinge of
pink or yellow, possess fine orient, are round, and are free of
surface blemishes. The grading of pearls for color requires considerable
experience to detect delicate differences. Various
classification names, such as &ldquo;ros&eacute;e&rdquo; for delicate pink shades,
are used. Fancy colored pearls are those with a strong yellow,
bronze, pink, green, blue, or black color. Grading for shapes,
which differ markedly, is easier. Spherical pearls are usually
drilled for beads; pear-shaped or drop pearls are used in earrings
and pendants; and &ldquo;boutons&rdquo; or button-shaped pearls, with
one flat side, are used for ear ornaments, cuff links, and rings.
Irregular, baroque pearls and tiny seed pearls are used in
jewelry designs with noble metals and perhaps other gemstones.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s finest pearls, called <i>oriental pearls</i>, come from the
fisheries of the Persian Gulf. Fine pearls also are found off the
coasts of Burma, Tahiti, New Guinea, Borneo, Venezuela and
western South America, and in the Gulf of California. Fresh-water
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
pearls of high quality, formed in pearl mussels, are found
in various rivers in Europe and the United States, especially in
rivers in the Mississippi Valley.</p>
<p>A method of growing <i>cultured pearls</i> has been well developed.
A mother-of-pearl bead is inserted in the oyster as an irritant,
and the animal is replaced in the sea in a cage. When oysters
so treated are recovered after a period of three to seven years,
the beads in the harvested crop usually are found to be coated
with a layer of nacre up to almost a sixteenth of an inch thick.</p>
<p>The cultured pearl can be identified only by the observance&mdash;through
a drill-hole or by X-ray&mdash;of the mother-of-pearl core,
which had been inserted in the oyster. An instrument called
an endoscope, devised for rapid testing of drilled pearls,
relies on a beam of strong light carried by a hollow needle.
The needle is inserted into the drill hole, and as it passes
through the center portion of a natural pearl a flash of light,
reflected through a mirror system in the needle, is observed.</p>
<h3>CORUNDUM
<br /><span class="smaller">(RUBY AND SAPPHIRE)</span></h3>
<p>Both <i>ruby</i> and <i>sapphire</i>, which are second only to diamond in
hardness, are of the mineral species corundum, an oxide of
aluminum. They are identical in all characteristics except
color. Most corundum is opaque, and it is mined in large
quantities for use as an abrasive. In a few places, such as
Moguk in Upper Burma and in Ceylon, clear corundum is
found that is suitable for use as a gem.</p>
<p>Red corundum is known as ruby. Its color, caused by traces
of chromium, ranges from rose through carmine to a dark
purplish red referred to as pigeon&rsquo;s blood red. Rubies of this
very desirable latter color often are called Burma rubies, and
they are the most costly of all the corundum gems.</p>
<p>All gem corundum having a color other than red is sapphire.
The name sapphire means blue, and this is the color most frequently
associated with this gemstone. The finest sapphires are
a velvety cornflower blue, and they come from Kashmir. Blue,
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
white, yellow, gold, pink, and all the other colors of corundum
are caused by the presence of slight traces of iron, chromium,
titanium, and other metals present as dissolved impurities in
the aluminum oxide. Frequently sapphires are found that show
patches of blue and yellow, or that have alternating zones of
red and blue. Pure corundum is colorless.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig35">
<img src="images/p19.jpg" alt="" width="566" height="800" />
<p class="pcap">A piece of uncut ruby,
from Burma, and five
small rubies of about
half a carat each, from
Ceylon. All have the
classic &ldquo;pigeon&rsquo;s blood&rdquo;
color. (Actual size.)</p>
</div>
<p>Most gem corundum comes from the Orient, at localities such
as Moguk in Upper Burma, near Bangkok in Thailand, Kashmir
in India, and Ceylon. Because of this primarily Asian origin, the
word <i>oriental</i> often is used with the names of other gems to

<p>During the formation of a corundum crystal, extremely
small needle-like inclusions of rutile sometimes occur in the
hexagonal pattern of the host crystal. When such inclusions
are arranged in this way by nature, they cause, in properly
cut stones, internal reflections that produce the optical phenomenon
known as asterism. The effect is that of a 6-rayed
star, and the gems in which asterism occurs are known as star
sapphires and star rubies. Asterism is rarer in ruby.</p>

<h3>BERYL
<br /><span class="smaller">(INCLUDES EMERALD AND AQUAMARINE)</span></h3>
<p>Beryl is probably the most widely used colored gemstone,
and under its several names in the gem world it is probably
the best known. When it is a rich green it is known as
<i>emerald</i>, and when it is the blue-green of sea water it is called
<i>aquamarine</i>. Varieties such as the rose-pink <i>morganite</i>, golden-yellow
<i>heliodor</i>, and colorless <i>goshenite</i> are less well known than
emerald and aquamarine but are equally attractive and satisfactory
gemstones.</p>
<p>Beryl is beryllium aluminum silicate. It frequently occurs in
well-formed hexagonal crystals, and its many colors result
from the presence of very small percentages of several different
elements. Emerald owes its rich green color to traces of
chromium, and the detection of this element is one of the means
of identifying true emerald. Aquamarine, comprising the green
and blue-green beryls, gets its color mainly from traces of
iron. Practically all of the deep blue aquamarine available in
jewelry stores results from the heat treating of greenish beryl
or certain yellow-brown beryls. The stones are heated carefully
to about 800&deg; F., and the color change is permanent. The
element lithium accounts for the color of pink beryl. As with
aquamarine, the color of yellow beryl is now considered to
be the result of traces of iron rather than uranium, as previously
thought. Pure beryl is colorless.</p>
<p>Beryl usually is found in pegmatites, which are very coarse-grained
granite rocks formed by the cooling of molten material
far beneath the earth&rsquo;s surface. As the rock cools and beryl and
other crystals are formed, the stresses introduced are so great
that the crystals frequently shatter so badly they are useless as
gem material. Frequently, too, impurities are introduced during
crystal formation, and consequently the gem materials are found
only where the crystals were able to form without interference&mdash;such
as in openings or cavities in the rock.</p>
<p>Tremendous beryl crystals weighing as much as several tons,
but not of gem quality, have been discovered in a few localities.
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
Large crystals of gem quality also occur in nature, and large
cut stones of aquamarine and other colors of beryl are relatively
common. Among the fine examples of beryl in the National
Gem Collection is a remarkably large (2054-carat), flawless
cut stone of rich yellow-green. This gem and others in the
collection weighing 1363 carats, 1000 carats, 914 carats, and
578 carats accentuate the occurrence of large gem crystals of
beryl in Brazil.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig39">
<img src="images/p21.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="560" />
<p class="pcap">Four large cut stones, all from Brazil, illustrate the color range of
beryl. Top, a 578-carat green beryl; left, a 235-carat morganite,
gift of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Ix, Jr.; bottom, a 133-carat gold beryl;
and, right, a 187-carat aquamarine. (Half actual size.)</p>
</div>
<p>The finest emeralds are not found in pegmatites. At Muzo
in Colombia, the most prolific source of the finest emeralds,
they occur in veins with calcite, quartz, dolomite, and pyrite.
The veins cut through dark-colored, carbonaceous limestone
and shale. Mining at Muzo began 350 years ago and still
continues sporadically to meet market requirements. Russian
emeralds occur as good-sized crystals in mica schist, a
metamorphic rock. They occur there with chrysoberyl, phenakite,
and common beryl. Some of the smaller stones have good
color and have been cut into valuable gems. Brazil, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
produces many extraordinary aquamarines and other beryls,
has not produced quality emeralds. Periodically, over the
centuries, there have been reports of new discoveries of
emerald, but so far none of these has begun to rival the Muzo
source in either quantity or quality of the gems produced.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig40">

<p class="pcap">This tremendous golden beryl from Brazil, weighing 2054 carats, is
the largest cut beryl known of this color. Cut stones of this size that
contain no visible flaws or inclusions are most unusual. (Three-fifths
actual size.)</p>
</div>
<p>Although Brazil supplies the finest aquamarine and Colombia
the finest emerald, several localities in the United States are
sources of good-quality beryl of these colors. Foremost among
these localities are Maine, California, and Connecticut for
aquamarine and North Carolina for emerald. Morganite of pale
pink to deep peach color, from California, is also notable.
Various New England mines in Maine, New Hampshire, and
Connecticut and the gem mines of the Pala and Mesa Grande
districts of California have produced other colors of gem
beryl. However, most of the beryl mined in the United States
is used as an ore for beryllium, as little of it is of gem quality.</p>
<p>Because of its hardness (about 8), vitreous luster, beautiful
color, and rarity, emerald always has been highly prized as a
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
gem. Fine-quality emeralds may be more costly than fine
diamonds. Other kinds of beryl have the same physical
properties as emerald, but since they are less rare their
relative value is lower.</p>
<p>Synthetic emerald of high gem quality has been marketed
successfully. A synthetic substitute for aquamarine is also
available; it is really a synthetic blue spinel.</p>

<h3>TOPAZ</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig41">
<img src="images/p22.jpg" alt="" width="481" height="800" />
<p class="pcap">Three different cutting
styles and colors of topaz.

than actual size.)</p>
</div>
<p>Because yellow is the most popular color of topaz it has
become customary to believe that all topaz is yellow.
Also, there is a tendency to believe that all yellow gemstones
are topaz. Neither
belief is correct. Stones of
yellow, sherry, blue, pink,
and colorless topaz all make
beautiful gems, and their
characteristics are identical
except for color. On the
other hand, citrine (a yellow
quartz), although entirely unrelated
to topaz, often is
disguised in the trade under
the names Brazilian topaz,
topaz quartz, or just topaz.
Great numbers of stones described and sold as yellow topaz really are the much commoner
citrine, which has few of the characteristics of fine topaz.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Topaz, an aluminum fluosilicate, has a hardness of 8, a
vitreous luster, and a relatively high refractive index. It is
found in near-perfect crystals that range in size from very small
to very large, with some giants weighing as much as several
hundred pounds. Most of these crystals, especially the largest
ones, are colorless, a characteristic that indicates relatively
high purity of composition. Although topaz gems have little
fire, they take a high polish and can be very brilliant. Great
care must be taken in cutting and polishing topaz because of
its ready cleavage. The desired cut and high polish can be
secured by avoiding excessive heat or pressure during the
operation and by planning facets so that none lies exactly
parallel to the cleavage direction.</p>
<p>Although crystals of gem-quality topaz are found in many
localities, perhaps the splendid blue ones from Russia and
the yellow, wine, blue, and colorless ones from Brazil are best
known. Some fine topaz has been found in the United States
in such widely separated areas as New Hampshire, Texas,
Colorado, and California. The light, golden brown topaz from
Colorado has an unfortunate tendency to fade in strong sunlight.
It remains to be seen whether similar topaz coming
recently from comparable occurrences in Mexico also will
fade. By a system of heating and cooling, certain of the red-brown
topaz crystals from Ouro Preto, Brazil, can be converted
to colors ranging from salmon pink to purple red. Quick
heating to high temperatures can completely remove color,
and sudden or uneven cooling may cloud or crack the stone.</p>
<h3>OPAL</h3>
<p>Opal has been admired for its great beauty since ancient
times, but this gemstone lacked commercial appeal until
the discovery of the Australian black opal late in the
19th century.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Opal is somewhat brittle, is sensitive to heat, and, in some
cases, tends to deteriorate despite the best of care. Therefore,
this stone lacks many of the physical characteristics required
for an ideal gem. These deficiencies would eliminate other
species from the list of gemstones, but the great beauty of its
flashing and shifting color patterns has made opal increasingly
popular. Even its name, coming from the ancient Sanskrit
&ldquo;upala,&rdquo; means precious stone.</p>
<p>With a hardness between 5&frac12; and 6&frac12;, opal is the softest of
the more popular gems. It is sufficiently hard, however, to be
used in jewelry, where its setting usually helps to protect it
from shock and abrasion.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig44">
<img src="images/p23.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="670" />
<p class="pcap">Black opal, so called because the
color flashes appear against a dark
background, is found in Australia.
It is quite rare, and large pieces
such as the ones shown here
have become extremely valuable.
(Almost actual size.)</p>
</div>
<p>Opal is unlike most
gemstones in that its flashing
color is not due to the
color of the stone itself, or
even to the color of its included
impurities. Rather,
it is due to the way in
which tiny opal particles
are grouped during its formation. Detailed photographs taken
through an electron microscope show clearly how precious
opal is deposited as spheres that are so small they are indistinguishable
under powerful optical microscopes. These spheres
are packed together in very orderly networks, row upon row
and layer upon layer, with tiny open spaces, also in rows,
between them. Masses of common opal lack this orderly internal
arrangement of spheres. White light striking the precious
opal is reflected independently by each row of spheres, much
like the reflections from a series of slats in a venetian blind.
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
Since these rows of spheres are spaced at
distances approximately the same as the
wavelength of light, a phenomenon known
as <i>diffraction</i> occurs. The separate reflections
interfere with each other in an
organized manner, cancelling out some
of the light wavelengths and reinforcing
others, producing color. The brilliant
color flashes are of different hues depending
on the sizes of the spheres of opal
and, therefore, the distances between rows. To provide the
best display of this optical effect, opal is almost always cut in
cabochon form rather than as faceted stones.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig45">
<img src="images/p24.jpg" alt="" width="338" height="797" />
<p class="pcap">Fire opals have rich fire; some have background
colors that vary from bright yellow through
orange and red; and some are colorless. Stones
such as the ones shown here, which weigh 7,

famous as their source. (Actual size.)</p>

</div>
<p>Common opal, which shows milky opalescence, does not
exhibit color flashes, and it is not used as a gemstone. Each of
the common varieties&mdash;such as hyalite, cacholong, and hydrophane&mdash;has
its own slightly different set of characteristics,
but only precious opal, with its dazzling color display, is
important for gem purposes. To take full advantage of the
small amounts of gem material available, or to bring out its
color better, <i>precious</i> opal is often cut as thin pieces and mounted
as doublets on some other backing. Also, the seams in rock
sometimes are cut so that the thin layer is exposed on a
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
thicker backing of the adjoining rock. Precious opal, or gem
opal, is classified as <i>white opal</i> when the color flashes are in a
whitish or light background, <i>black opal</i> when the background
material is gray, blue-gray, or black, and <i>fire opal</i> when the
background is more translucent and red, reddish orange, or
reddish yellow.</p>
<p>Precious opal has been found in several areas of the world&mdash;in
nodules, in seams in rock, or as replacements of other
minerals or even of wood and shell. Hungarian deposits were
well known in Roman times, but these and other deposits
became insignificant with the discovery of opal in Australia
in the late 19th century. Opal deposits were discovered in
1889 at White Cliffs in New South Wales, and other important
discoveries in Australia followed, including deposits
at Lightning Ridge in New South Wales that produce very
dark stones and the rich fields of white opal at Coober Pedy
in South Australia. Mexico has remained for a long time the
principal source of richly colored fire opals, with the most important
deposits located in the state of Quer&eacute;taro, where
mines have been worked intermittently since 1835. This has
made the town of Quer&eacute;taro today the center for the trade
and cutting of Mexican opal.</p>

<h3>SPINEL</h3>
<p>Two of the more famous stones in the British crown jewels
are the Black Prince&rsquo;s Ruby and the Timur Ruby, but
neither of these stones is really ruby. Like the great red
gem in the crown that belonged to the Russian Empress
Catherine II, these two British stones are spinel. Although
spinel occurs in many colors, such as yellow, green, violet,
brown, and black, it is the red spinel that usually is seen in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
gem trade. There are several varieties of red spinel, such as
<i>ruby spinel</i>, <i>balas ruby</i>, <i>rubicelle</i>, and <i>almandine spinel</i>&mdash;all of which
refer to the color resemblance to ruby.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig47">
<img src="images/p25.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="579" />
<p class="pcap">The hues and tints of spinel show subtle variations that are matched
only by those of tourmaline. Unlike tourmaline, however, spinel
may be bright ruby red. The cut stones curving around two pieces
of rough from Burma weigh (left to right) 30 carats (Ceylon), 34
carats (Burma), 36 carats (Burma), 30 carats (Ceylon), and 22 carats
(Ceylon). (Three-fourths actual size.)</p>
</div>
<p>Spinel is an oxide of magnesium and aluminum, and it is not
related to ruby. However, because its hardness (8) is only
slightly less than that of ruby and its brilliance is about equal
to that of ruby, spinel makes an excellent substitute for that
gem. Also, because it is more plentiful, spinel costs much less.
It is interesting that red spinel, like ruby, gets its color from
the presence of traces of chromium.</p>
<p>Synthetic blue spinel is widely used as a substitute for
aquamarine, and synthetic spinels of other colors are used as
substitutes for many gems. However, the synthetic stones are
not ordinarily made in the subtle shades so characteristic of
natural spinel. Completely colorless spinel apparently exists
only as a synthetic material. Actually, because of its hardness,
durability, and many attractive colors, spinel makes a fine
gemstone in its own right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Like ruby and several other gemstones, spinel is found
chiefly in the gem gravels of Ceylon, Burma, and Thailand.
Appreciable amounts of spinel occur in the Ceylon gem gravels
as worn, rounded pebbles of many colors. In the Burmese
gravel deposits the spinel is often found as well-formed
octahedral crystals. Near Moguk, in Burma, spinel has been
found in its original position in the limestone rocks as well as
in the eroded stream deposits.</p>

<h3>QUARTZ
<br /><span class="smaller">(INCLUDES ROCK CRYSTAL, AMETHYST, AND CITRINE)</span></h3>
<p>Few gemstones can compete with quartz for variety of color.
Having a hardness of 7 and occurring in many beautiful
varieties, only the relative abundance of quartz prevents
the species from attaining top rank among gemstones.</p>
<p>The two kinds of quartz, crystalline and cryptocrystalline
(fine-grained) quartz, occur in all kinds of mineral deposits
throughout the world. Much of this material is suitable for
cutting gems.</p>
<p>Colorless crystalline quartz, or <i>rock crystal</i>, makes attractive
faceted gems, and it is used as a suitable substitute for diamond
and zircon even though it lacks the fire and brilliance of those
gemstones. Some very large, flawless crystals of colorless
crystalline quartz have been found. The great Warner Crystal
Ball, with a diameter of 12&#8542; inches and weighing 106&frac34;
pounds, was cut from such a crystal. In addition to the name
rock crystal, colorless crystalline quartz appears in the
jewelry trade under such names as rhinestone (not to be
confused with the glass substitute), Herkimer diamond (from
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
Herkimer County, N. Y.), and Cape May diamond (from
Cape May, N. J.).</p>
<p>The most popular variety of quartz is <i>amethyst</i>, a transparent
form whose color ranges from pale violet to deep purple. In
many cut stones of amethyst the color intensity changes
sharply from section to section. This is due to irregular color
zoning common to amethyst crystals. The actual cause of the
purple color in amethyst is not very well understood. There are
fewer cut stones of amethyst in very large sizes because of the
rarity of large, flawless, well-colored crystals.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig48">
<img src="images/p26.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="800" />
<p class="pcap">This 4500-carat pale smoky quartz
egg from California rests on a gold
stand set with Montana sapphires.
The unique gem was cut and its
stand was designed and made by
Capt. John Sinkankas as a difficult
exercise in the lapidary art.
The quartz egg is 4 inches long
and almost 3 inches in diameter.</p>
</div>
<p>The name <i>citrine</i> (from the French word for lemon) attempts
to describe the yellow color of another variety of quartz.
Actually, the normal coloring of citrine varies from yellow to
red-orange and red-brown,
but the yellow
sometimes rivals the
yellow of topaz. In
addition to the normal
color range, the colors
of citrine may grade
through a grayish yellow
variety known as
<i>cairngorm</i> and a grayish
variety called <i>smoky
quartz</i> to a black variety
called <i>morion</i>.
Other varieties that
add color dimensions
to the group of quartz
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
gemstones are <i>rose quartz</i> and <i>milky quartz</i>. Like amethyst, the
reason for the color in rose quartz has not been definitely
established. Milky quartz owes its color to myriads of tiny
cavities containing water or liquid carbon dioxide.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig49">
<img src="images/p26a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="607" />
<p class="pcap">A 783-carat step-cut citrine of deep, rich color dwarfs a 278-carat
brilliant-cut citrine (at left), a 90-carat smoky quartz, and a 91-carat

so dark that it appears to be opaque. The other three stones came
from Brazil. The briolette and brilliant-cut citrines were cut and
donated to the Smithsonian Institution by Albert R. Cutter. (Slightly
less than half actual size.)</p>
</div>
<p>The range of color in quartz is somewhat surprising, considering
that the mineral is a simple silicon dioxide. Some of
the colors, as with corundum and some other gemstones, are
due to traces of impurities. In quartz, these consist mainly of
oxides of iron, manganese, and titanium. However, all the
reasons for quartz coloration in its many varieties are not
known.</p>

it is represented by a 1362-carat

Carolina. (Almost actual size.)</p>
</div>
<p>In addition to possessing wide variation of color, quartz, like
sapphire and certain other gemstones, can exhibit asterism or
chatoyancy. The well-known <i>tiger&rsquo;s-eye</i> from West Griqualand,
South Africa, owes its eye effect to the fact that its material
is a replacement of fibrous asbestos by cryptocrystalline quartz.
The color of tiger&rsquo;s-eye arises from the partial alteration of the
asbestos to yellow-brown iron oxides before it is replaced by
quartz. Inclusions of rutile, tourmaline, or actinolite needles
may produce attractive patterns in quartz, but they do not
always cause chatoyancy. The material containing such inclusions
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
is called sagenitic quartz, or it may be descriptively
named, such as rutilated quartz, tourmalinated quartz, and so
forth. Sagenitic quartz is usually cut as cabochons rather than
as faceted stones since the inclusions are of greater interest
than the quartz itself.</p>
<p>If the foreign inclusions consist of tiny flakes of hematite or
mica, the quartz assumes a spangled appearance and is called
<i>aventurine</i>.</p>
<p>Crystals of quartz varieties that are opaque or that contain
visible inclusions normally are cut as cabochons to take advantage
of the body color or to make the inclusions more visible.
Crystals of the transparent varieties are fashioned in any of
several cutting styles, depending on whether it is desired to
take maximum advantage of color or of brilliance. Because of
its availability in fairly large, flawless pieces in various colors,
quartz has been used extensively in carving. The Chinese
have excelled in carving large, ornate objects of rock crystal.</p>
<p>Although quartz occurs in many varieties and its crystals are
cut in many styles, it is easily identified by its refractive index
of 1.55, specific gravity of 2.65, and hardness of 7.</p>

<h3>CHRYSOBERYL
<br /><span class="smaller">(INCLUDES ALEXANDRITE AND CAT&rsquo;S-EYE)</span></h3>
<p>With color ranging from shades of yellow and brown
through blue-green to olive, and with a hardness of
8&frac12;, chrysoberyl has most of the characteristics necessary for a
fine gem. Rare stones of high-quality chrysoberyl demand
fairly high prices, and they are sought eagerly by the connoisseur
of gemstones.</p>
<p>Chrysoberyl is beryllium aluminate,
and thus is closely related to the gemstone
spinel, which is magnesium aluminate.
When pure, chrysoberyl is colorless and
relatively uninteresting as a gemstone
because of its lack of color dispersion and
its moderate refractive index of 1.75.
However, few pure samples are known, as
chrysoberyl normally contains some iron
or chromium in place of aluminum and
some iron in place of beryllium. As a
result of such impurities, the color of
chrysoberyl my be yellowish, greenish,
or brownish.</p>
<p>Chrysoberyl and beryl are the only important
gemstones containing the element
beryllium. The minerals beryllonite,
euclase, hambergite, and phenakite also
contain this element, but they are rare and
seldom are seen as cut gems.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig52">

<p class="pcap">One of the finest chrysoberyl cat&rsquo;s-eyes
in existence is the 58-carat
Maharani from Ceylon. (Actual
size.)</p>
</div>
<p>The <i>alexandrite</i> variety of chrysoberyl has two colors in delicate
balance, and it changes from a columbine red to an
emerald green when viewed under different light. When
viewed in daylight, which is richer in green, the color balance
shifts toward green, and that hue is seen by the observer. Under
artificial light, normally richer in red, the color balance shifts
toward red, and the stone seems to have changed to that color.
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
This extremely rare stone, named after Czar Alexander II of
Russia, is found only occasionally, in Russia and Ceylon. The
Russian stones, found with emerald in mica schist, tend to be
smaller than the Ceylon stones and have a color change going
from emerald green to violet-red. The Ceylon stones, found as
pebbles in gem gravels, have a color change going from a less-emerald
green to a browner red. The 66-carat, record-size
alexandrite in the National Collection shows the color change
typical of Ceylon stones. A synthetic stone is commonly
marketed as synthetic alexandrite, but this substitute not only
is man-made but is actually synthetic corundum instead of
synthetic chrysoberyl.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig53">
<img src="images/p28a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="516" />
<p class="pcap">In addition to its fine cat&rsquo;s-eyes and its color-changing alexandrite
varieties, chrysoberyl occurs in handsome stones that vary in depth
of color. Shown here with an uncut twinned crystal of gem quality
from Brazil are a 46-carat stone from Brazil (left) and a 121-carat
stone from Ceylon. The uncut crystal is a gift of Bernard T. Rocca, Sr.
(Two-thirds actual size.)</p>
</div>
<p><i>Cat&rsquo;s-eye</i> chrysoberyl contains myriads of tiny fiberlike channels
arranged in parallel position. When the stone is cut as a
cabochon, a band of light is reflected from the curved top of
the stone, producing an effect that resembles the slit pupil of a
cat&rsquo;s eye.</p>

<h3>TOURMALINE</h3>
<p>Because of its great color range, which includes pink, green,
blue, yellow, brown, and black in many different shades
and combinations of shades, tourmaline is one of the most popular
of the colored gemstones. Tourmaline with a color near
emerald green is particularly popular.</p>
<p>Chemically, tourmaline is a very complex borosilicate, and
its color is determined by the various elements present in it.
Tourmaline crystals having sodium, lithium, or potassium are
either colorless, red, or green; those having iron are blue, blue-green,
or black; and those having magnesium are colorless,
yellow-brown, or blackish brown.</p>
<p>Some crystals of tourmaline are of two colors, and stones
of mixed colors, such as pink and green, can be cut from these.
The color mixing may show as zoning with the core color of
the crystal overlaid by another color and perhaps even additional
layers of other colors. Zoned crystals with a core of
deep pink covered by a layer of green have been called &ldquo;watermelon
tourmaline.&rdquo; Because its refractive index of about 1.6 is
too low to give it marked brilliance, and its color dispersion
is too low to give it fire, the tourmaline relies almost solely
on the beauty of its color for its rank in popularity.</p>
<p>Although tourmaline has a low refractive index and low dispersion,
it exhibits remarkable dichroism. In other words, it
can present different tints to the viewer depending on the
direction that the light is traveling through the crystal. When
viewed down the long, or vertical, axis of the crystal, the color
of tourmaline is much stronger than when viewed from the side.
This means that if the crystal is dark the cutter will have to cut
the stone with the flat part, or table, parallel to the long axis
of the crystal. The color of the gemstone then will be lightened
when viewed from its table, since this is the direction of
lighter color. Similarly, the table of a lighter colored crystal
can be cut perpendicular to the long axis in order to produce
a deeper colored gem.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<div class="img" id="fig54">
<img src="images/p29.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="576" />
<p class="pcap">Green seems to be the best known commercial color of tourmaline,
but this extremely variable gem species exhibits many subtle shades
of color, as shown here. At upper left, a 104-carat stone from Mozambique;
at upper right, a 173-carat stone from Mozambique; at lower
left, a 111-carat stone from Manchuria; and a 35-carat stone from
Brazil. (Actual size.)</p>
</div>
<p>Some tourmaline crystals contain threadlike tubes or inclusions
of microscopic size running parallel to its length. When
cut as cabochons, such crystals give a good &ldquo;cat&rsquo;s-eye&rdquo; effect.</p>
<p>Tourmaline has no distinct cleavage and has a hardness
somewhat above 7, and these characteristics make the stone
sufficiently resistant to normal shock and wear so that it is
highly satisfactory for use in jewelry.</p>
<p>Noted deposits of tourmaline are located in the Ural
Mountains of Russia, Ceylon, Burma, South-West Africa,
Madagascar, Brazil, Maine, and California. Crystals from each
of these localities seem to have their own color specialties. The
deposits in San Diego County, Calif., are unique in that all
colors except brown are found there. In the early 1900&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
pink and red tourmaline was shipped from there to China for
carving, but this thriving trade stopped with the end of
Chinese imperial reign. The tourmaline deposits at Paris,
Auburn, and Hebron, Maine, have furnished a number of
excellent gems, especially of blue and green colors.</p>

<h3>ZIRCON</h3>
<p>Zircon, because of its high refractive index and high dispersion,
approaches diamond in degree of brilliance and
fire. On only casual examination it is quite possible to mistake
a well-cut, colorless zircon for a diamond. However, a
careful examination of the back facets of such a stone, when
viewed through the table, would show strong double refraction,
a characteristic of zircon but not of diamond. Zircon&rsquo;s double
refraction makes the back facet edges appear doubled. Since
diamond is &ldquo;singly refracting,&rdquo; it cannot produce this double
appearance of the back facets.</p>
<p>Zircon is brittle and has a hardness of just over 7, while
diamond&rsquo;s hardness, as we have seen, is rated at 10. After
being worn in jewelry for a long period of time, zircon will
show signs of chipping on the facet edges. Under the same
conditions, diamond would remain unchanged. Because of this
tendency for facet edges to chip, it is the practice in the gem
trade to pack cut zircons separately. If a number of zircons
were placed in the same paper packet there would be a risk
of &ldquo;paper wear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the gem trade, the most important zircons are those that
are colorless, golden brown, or sky blue. Such stones originally
were reddish brown zircon pebbles from Indochina, but they
have been converted by being subjected to temperatures
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
approaching 1800&deg; F. for periods of up to two hours. When
the original zircons are heated in a closed container, the stones
become blue or colorless; when a flow of air is allowed through
the container, the stones become golden yellow, red, or
colorless. In most of these converted stones the color remains
quite stable, but in some it may revert to an unattractive
greenish or brownish blue after a period of time.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig55">
<img src="images/p30.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="677" />
<p class="pcap">The beautiful colors of these brilliant zircons are the result of heat
treatment given to natural, reddish brown stream pebbles. The three
stones at the left (from top) weigh 118, 103, and 98 carats, and the
ones on the right weigh 106 and 29 carats. The 106-carat stone came
from Thailand, the others from Indochina. (Four-fifths actual size.)</p>
</div>
<p>In addition to being reddish brown, natural zircon may vary
from almost colorless to yellow, red, orange, and brown or
from yellow-green to dark green and, occasionally, blue.</p>
<p>The most important producing areas of gem zircon are in a
region of Indochina that comprises parts of Thailand, Viet Nam,
and Laos. Additional gem zircon, like so many of the other
gem species, is recovered from near Moguk in Upper Burma and
from the gem gravels of Ceylon.</p>
<p>There is no synthetic zircon on the market, but a bright
blue synthetic spinel is sometimes used to simulate zircon
successfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<h3>PERIDOT</h3>
<p>The relative rarity of peridot and the ease with which it
can be simulated in glass, whose luster it approximates,
probably account for the low popular demand for this gemstone.
Although peridot has little brilliance and no fire, its
unusual color and glassy luster produce a unique effect that
serves to make it attractive.</p>
<p>The color of peridot is an unusual bottle green that shades,
in some stones, toward yellow-green and, more rarely, toward
brown. In 1952 it was discovered
that almost all of the brown
gems believed to have been
peridot in various gem collections
were actually of an
entirely unrelated species, which
since has been named sinhalite.
Brown peridot still remains rare
and is somewhat of a collector&rsquo;s
item.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig56">
<img src="images/p31.jpg" alt="" width="382" height="800" />
<p class="pcap">To exhibit its unique color to best
advantage, peridot usually is cut
so as to have a relatively large
table, as shown in these examples.
The largest gem, weighing 310
carats, is from the Egyptian island
of Zebirget in the Red Sea and is
the largest cut peridot known. The
other two, weighing 287 carats
and 109 carats, are from Burma.
(Three-fifths actual size.)</p>
</div>
<p>The green of peridot, which
is quite different from the green
of other gemstones, is due to
some iron included in its composition.
It is suspected that a
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
trace of nickel contributes to the liveliness of the color.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig57">
<img src="images/p31a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="531" />
<p class="pcap">This photo shows the color of peridot projected onto the background.
The larger gem is the 310-carat stone shown in the prior illustration.
The stone on the right weighs 109 carats and is
from Burma; the other peridot weighs 46 carats and is from Egypt.
(Almost actual size.)</p>
</div>
<p>Peridot has a hardness of only 6&frac12; and a rather strong
tendency to cleave, and these characteristics reduce its value
for use in jewelry exposed to rough wear. It is better used in
pins, earrings, and pendants than in rings.</p>
<p>Peridot is a gem name for the common mineral olivine, a
magnesium silicate. Olivine is fund in numerous places, and
small gemmy pieces are found in many localities. Many of the
largest and best gems of peridot have come from mines on the
Egyptian island of Zebirget (Island of St. John) in the Red
Sea, but most gem peridot now comes from Burma. Great numbers
of small stones have been cut from olivine found in Arizona
gravels.</p>
<p>Centuries ago, peridot was known by the name topaz, since
the stones came from Topazos, the island now known as
Zebirget. The name topaz, as we have seen, is used today for an
entirely different mineral species.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<h3>SPODUMENE</h3>
<p>Spodumene, a lithium aluminum silicate, is one of the very
few gemstones containing lithium. It has had more importance
as a gemstone in the United States than elsewhere, a
situation due to early discoveries of unique occurrences of a
lavender-pink variety at Branchville, Conn., in 1879 and in
San Diego County, Calif, about 20 years later. At the time of
the discovery of the California material, the variety was
named <i>kunzite</i> in honor of G. F. Kunz, a noted American
gemologist of the times.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig58">
<img src="images/p32.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="637" />
<p class="pcap">The 177-carat kunzite (at lower left) is a large flawless stone cut
from California material of this variety of spodumene. It was given
to the Smithsonian Institution by the American Gem Society. The
other stones, all from Brazil, represent the more usual shades of
spodumene. They weigh 327 carats (top left), 256 carats (top right),
and 69 carats. (About half actual size.)</p>
</div>
<p>The finding of a bright green variety, <i>hiddenite</i>, in North
Carolina about 1880 greatly stimulated the interest of American
gem collectors. Some of the bright green spodumene
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
coming from Brazil in recent years compares very favorably in
color with North Carolina hiddenite. Other than in a scattered
few of these unusual occurrences of kunzite and hiddenite,
spodumene usually is found in yellow and yellow-green
shades, with Brazil and Madagascar being the chief sources.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig59">
<img src="images/p32a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="688" />
<p class="pcap">This 880-carat kunzite from Brazil is one of the largest stones of its
kind. (About actual size.)</p>
</div>
<p>Spodumene has a hardness of about 7, but with a refractive
index of about 1.66 and a low dispersion there seems to be
relatively little to recommend it as a gemstone. The fact that it
exhibits a very strong tendency to cleave in two different
directions would seem to rule it out completely as being too
difficult to cut. Nevertheless, the production and purchase of
cut stones of spodumene persist because of the beauty of
the gem.</p>
<p>The kunzite and hiddenite varieties of spodumene show
strong <i>pleochroism</i>, or the ability to show three different colors
when viewed in the direction of different axes. Some of the
large Brazilian kunzite crystals mined in the early 1960&rsquo;s have
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
an intense rose-violet color when viewed along the long axis
of the crystal but have pale blue-violet and pale tan colors
when viewed from the other two directions. When heat
treated, or exposed to strong light, this Brazilian kunzite
loses its tan and bluish colors but retains the intense rose-violet.
Because of spodumene&rsquo;s pleochroism, the direction of
cutting in the stones becomes extremely important, as it
must be done in a manner that will take advantage of the
violet color in kunzite and the green color in hiddenite.</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>VARIETIES</dt>
<dd>Kunzite: Lavender violet to rose violet</dd>
<dd>Hiddenite: Deep green</dd></dl>
<h3>GARNET</h3>
<p>The name garnet is applied to a group of six closely related
silicate minerals that are alike in crystal structure but
that differ mainly in the substitution of certain metallic
elements in their composition. These minerals are:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt><i>Pyrope</i>, magnesium aluminum garnet</dt>
<dt><i>Almandine</i>, iron aluminum garnet</dt>
<dt><i>Spessartine</i>, manganese aluminum garnet</dt>
<dt><i>Uvarovite</i>, calcium chromium garnet</dt>
<dt><i>Grossular</i>, calcium aluminum garnet</dt>
<dt><i>Andradite</i>, calcium iron garnet</dt></dl>
<p>Most natural garnets have compositions intermediate between
members of the basic group of six. For example, there are
garnets having compositions anywhere between pyrope and
almandine, depending on the amount of difference in the
magnesium or iron content. These same garnets may even have
varying amounts of manganese, and thus be partially
spessartine.</p>
<p>The six garnets in the basic group are found in considerable
quantity in many areas, but seldom are they of sufficiently high
quality to be considered gemstone material. Even when stones
of gem quality are found, their colors&mdash;particularly the reds&mdash;tend
to be so intense that they seem to be opaque.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<div class="img" id="fig60">
<img src="images/p33.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="616" />
<p class="pcap">Garnets occur in several colors, although most people think of them
as red. Shown here are a 54-carat spessartine from Brazil (top
right), a 6-carat rhodolite from North Carolina (at left), a magnificent
10-carat green demantoid from Russia, a 9-carat grossular from
Ceylon (bottom), and a 26-carat spessartine from Virginia. (Seven-eighths
actual size.)</p>
</div>
<p>Garnet has a hardness (about 7) suitable for gemstone
material and a fairly high refractive index (1.74 and above).</p>
<p>Ruby red pyrope is the most popular variety of garnet. It is
found in Bohemia, in Czechoslovakia, where it occurs as small,
poorly shaped crystals. Red pyrope also is found in Africa,
where it is called Cape ruby, and in Arizona, where it is sold
as Arizona ruby. Another kind of pyrope called <i>rhodolite</i> is noted
for its soft, rosy purple color. Actually, rhodolite is one of the
intermixed garnets with a composition somewhere between
pyrope and almandine. Most of the fine rhodolite gems have
come from North Carolina.</p>
<p>Almandine is popular in its deep red, transparent form, but
since the red is so dark and intense that it appears black, the
stones usually are cut as cabochons with the back hollowed
out. This makes them thinner, and thus lightens their color.
Garnets cut in this manner are all known as carbuncles.
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
Brazil, India, Ceylon, Australia, and parts of the United
States are important sources of almandine.</p>
<p>Although spessartine has a rich orange color, it is not often
used as a gemstone because of the relative rarity of gem-quality
cutting material. This mineral gets its name from the
town of Spessart, Germany, where it was first found. Excellent
spessartine with colors ranging from orange to brown has
been found at Amelia Court House, Va., and quality gems
have been cut from such material. Ceylon, Burma, Madagascar,
and Brazil also have furnished some gem spessartine.</p>
<p>The chromium garnet, uvarovite, generally is too poor in
quality for cutting. Uvarovite crystals, which are emerald
green in color, occur in only small sizes. They are found
mostly in Russia, Finland, and California.</p>
<p>Grossular varies in color. It occurs chiefly in some shade of
red, green, yellow, or brown, depending on the impurities
present. When pure, grossular is colorless. A kind of grossular
called <i>hessonite</i> has an attractive cinnamon color, and it is found
mainly in Ceylon. Because of its color it can easily be confused
with spessartine, which it closely resembles.</p>
<p>Andradite, a very common garnet, usually is found in
shades of red, black, brown, yellow, or green. Some types of
gem andradite have special names for different colors: <i>topazolite</i>,
yellow; <i>demantoid</i>, green; and <i>melanite</i>, sparkling black. The
very valuable demantoid is found in Russia and Italy.</p>

<h3>JADE</h3>
<p>The name jade is applied to two unrelated minerals&mdash;<i>nephrite</i>
and <i>jadeite</i>&mdash;that have somewhat similar characteristics.</p>
<p>Jadeite, the rarer of the two, is a sodium aluminum silicate
that belongs to a group of rock-forming minerals known as
pyroxenes. Its color varies from white to emerald green and
many other colors. Jadeite is highly prized, and when it occurs
as emerald green it is considered one of the most valuable
gemstones. This
kind of jade is
found in many
places, but the most
important occurrence
is in Upper
Burma. Nephrite, a
more common species,
is a calcium
magnesium iron silicate
belonging to a
group of rock-forming
minerals known
as amphiboles. The
color varies from white to a dark spinach green and black.
Among the places where nephrite occurs are New Zealand,
Turkestan, Siberia, Alaska, China, Silesia, and certain parts
of the western United States, notably in Wyoming and
California.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig61">

<p class="pcap">This emerald green jadeite carving,

Monell Vetlesen collection.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Jade is not particularly hard (6&frac12;), but it is very tough, and
this characteristic makes it an excellent material for carving.
Even when subjected to punishing usage, jade resists chipping
and wear. It was used for making tools and weapons by
primitive peoples who lived in what is now Mexico, Switzerland,
France, Greece, Egypt, Asia Minor, and in other places.
The jade implements fashioned by these peoples have survived
well the ravages of time.</p>
<p>The Chinese and Japanese prize jade highly. In their
countries, tradition has assigned to jade medicinal and spiritual
values, and has associated with it the cardinal virtues of
charity, modesty, courage, justice, and wisdom. As a consequence,
these peoples long ago developed the carving of jade
as a high art. Among the
magnificent Chinese jade
carvings in the National Gem
Collection are 130 pieces
produced mostly during the
Ching Dynasty (1644-1912),
when the art of jade carving
was at its peak. Many of these
jades were carved in imitation
of the revered bronze
ceremonial vessels of ancient
times. This collection was
presented to the Smithsonian
Institution in 1959 by Mr.
Edmund C. Monell in behalf
of the estate of his mother,
Mrs. Maude Monell Vetlesen
of New York.</p>

<h3>GEMSTONES FOR THE COLLECTOR</h3>
<p>A number of mineral species have produced cut gemstones
that fulfill every necessary requirement of beauty,
durability, and rarity, but their popularity and commercial
success have been sharply limited because of insufficient supply.
In some cases of even adequate supply such gemstones do not
compete with other, more plentiful kinds that exhibit the same
characteristics. The scarcity of these minerals does not diminish
their standing as potential gem material&mdash;it merely points up
the effect of accidental natural distribution of these species.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig63">
<img src="images/p36.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="604" />
<p class="pcap">A magnificent set of 16
matched sphenes from
Switzerland, gift of Nina
Lea, almost encircles a
110-carat sinhalite (a rare
magnesium borate) and
a 22-carat kornerupine,
both from Ceylon. The
man&rsquo;s gold ring indicates
the sizes of these unusual
stones.</p>
</div>
<p>Among the rarer minerals that produce good gemstones are
cordierite, benitoite, euclase, phenakite, beryllonite, willemite,
wernerite, danburite, datolite, axinite, brazilianite, andalusite,
sillimanite, kyanite, kornerupine, enstatite, diopside, epidote,
sphene, sinhalite, and orthoclase. Willemite, a rare zinc silicate
found in only a few localities, is typical of these rarer minerals.
The famous zinc mines at Franklin, N. J., produced a few large
gemmy crystals of willemite, and some fine gemstones were cut
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
from some of these. Willemite&rsquo;s borderline hardness of 5 to 5&frac12;
and its extreme rarity effectively eliminate it from the gem
market, but the collector who is able to obtain a good stone of
this material is indeed fortunate.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig64">
<img src="images/p36a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="582" />
<p class="pcap">Exotic gems that represent collectors&rsquo; items lie beside a 3&frac14;-inch-long
box of Russian lapis lazuli. The stones are (left row, from top)
a 28-carat andalusite from Brazil, gift of Fred C. Kennedy, a 10-carat
cordierite from Ceylon, a 29-carat apatite from Burma, and (right
row) a 42-carat brazilianite from Brazil, a 13-carat euclase from
Brazil, a 29-carat wernerite from Brazil, and a 61-carat orthoclase
from Madagascar.</p>
</div>
<p>Some mineral species, although beautiful when cut, and
prized by collectors, are entirely too soft, are too easily
cleaved, or have some other physical weakness that renders them
useless as commercial gemstones. Sphalerite, apatite, fluorite,
calcite, cerussite, zincite, and hematite are included in this
group. Sphalerite is typical; it produces brilliant and colorful
gemstones that hold their own among other stones of great
beauty. Unfortunately, this zinc sulfide, with a hardness of
3&frac12; to 4, is so soft and cleaves so readily that it is very
difficult to cut properly, and it cannot be used in jewelry.</p>

<br />SOME NOTABLE GEMS IN THE COLLECTION</h2>
<p>The Smithsonian&rsquo;s collection of gems continues to grow and improve
rapidly, and it changes character constantly as important new
gemstones are added and less important ones are retired. Approximately
one-third of the gems in the collection in 1965 are itemized in the
following list. Included are some of the largest gems of each kind, some
of the more interesting stones, and some small gems notable for the
places from which they came. Though listed by species and size, some
of the larger stones are not included, and neither are most cabochons,
rough opal, beads, carvings, and spheres. The descriptions listed include,
in order, weight in carats; color; popular name or other description, if
any; place of origin; and U. S. National Museum catalog number and
name of donor. Gems in the Lea and Roebling collections usually are
indicated by the letters &ldquo;L&rdquo; and &ldquo;R.&rdquo;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
